Modules:
    JS modularization happens using Modules

    each file is treated as a module 

    local variables have the function as scope and cannot be accessed outside the function 

    Module can export its variables with module.export 

How to use a module in a different flie ? 

    NodeJS we need to use the require function
    Core Modules : Modules which come with NodeJS
    const fs = require('fs');
    "So basically we call the require function with its module name"

    Local Module: This module is the one which is created by us; 

    eg: 
        We include local modules using the relative path of the file
        const fs = require('./..');


    
    How is a server made in NodeJS ? ?
        
        We need to require a core module 

        const http = require('http');
        
        This will give us access to this core module. 

        // Then we make the server by using this core module 

        const server = http.createServer(); // This probably is a function call; 

        // This module is a event emmiter, which means we can attach event listeners to it.
