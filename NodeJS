Modules:
    JS modularization happens using Modules

    each file is treated as a module 

    local variables have the function as scope and cannot be accessed outside the function 

    Module can export its variables with module.export 

How to use a module in a different flie ? 

    NodeJS we need to use the require function
    Core Modules : Modules which come with NodeJS
    const fs = require('fs');
    "So basically we call the require function with its module name"

    Local Module: This module is the one which is created by us; 

    eg: 
        We include local modules using the relative path of the file
        const fs = require('./..');
